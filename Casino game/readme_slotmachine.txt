Description:

This Python script simulates a simple fruit slot machine game. The user inserts money, spins the reels, and wins based on matching fruit symbols.

How it works:

User Input: The script prompts the user to enter the amount of money they want to insert.
Reel Spinning: The script randomly generates three fruit symbols from a predefined list.
Win Calculation: The script checks if any of the fruit symbols match. If all three match, the user wins triple their bet; if two match, they win double their bet.
Output: The script displays the results of the spin and the amount won.
Play Again: The script asks the user if they want to play another round.
