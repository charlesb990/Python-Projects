This Python script calculates the shipping cost for packages based on their weight. The calculation includes a base shipping cost and a sales tax.

How it works:

User Input: The script prompts the user to enter the weight of the package in units (e.g., pounds).
Shipping Cost Calculation: The shipping_cost function determines the base shipping cost based on the weight using a tiered pricing structure.
Tax Calculation: The tax function calculates the sales tax based on the total shipping cost.
Total Calculation: The main function combines the shipping cost and tax to determine the final total cost.
