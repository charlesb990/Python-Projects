This Python script calculates the optimal number of buildings with the shortest production time required to maintain a continuous production flow in a factory setting within the Anno 1800 game. 


How to use: 

1. User Input: The script prompts the user to enter the number of buildings and their respective production times.
2. Building Ratio Calculation: It determines the building ratio by identifying the buildings with the shortest production time and counting how many buildings share this shortest time.
3. Needed Shortest Buildings: The script calculates the minimum number of buildings with the shortest production time needed to ensure a consistent production flow, considering the total production time of the slower buildings.

What you get: 

Run the script: Execute the Python script in your preferred environment.
Input values: Follow the prompts to enter the number of buildings and their production times.
View results: The script will output the following information:
Total number of buildings
Production times for each building
Indices of buildings with the shortest production time
Count of buildings with the shortest production time
Minimum number of buildings with the shortest production time needed
