This Python script implements a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

How it works:

Random Number Generation: The script generates a random number between 1 and 100.
User Input: The script prompts the user to enter their guess.
Input Validation: The script ensures that the user enters a valid integer between 1 and 100.
Comparison: The script compares the user's guess to the random number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Game Loop: The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
