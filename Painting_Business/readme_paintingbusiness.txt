This Python script calculates the estimated cost of painting a surface based on the area to be painted and the cost of paint and labor.

How it works:

User Input: The script prompts the user to enter the square footage of the surface to be painted and the price per gallon of the selected paint.
Paint Calculation: The calculate_paint function estimates the number of gallons of paint needed based on a coverage rate of 115 square feet per gallon.
Labor Calculation: The calculate_labor function estimates the number of labor hours needed based on a rate of 8 hours per 115 square feet.
Cost Calculation: The script calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the paint price and the number of labor hours by the labor rate.
Output: The script displays the estimated number of gallons of paint needed, labor hours required, paint cost, labor cost, and total cost.
