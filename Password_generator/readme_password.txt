This Python script generates a random password of a specified length using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

How it works:

Import Modules: The script imports the secrets and string modules.
Password Length: The N variable defines the desired length of the password.
Random Character Generation: The random.choices function randomly selects N characters from the string.ascii_letters string, which contains all uppercase and lowercase letters.
Password Creation: The selected characters are joined together to form the password.
Output: The generated password is printed to the console.
