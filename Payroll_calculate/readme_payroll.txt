This Python script calculates the gross pay of an employee based on their hourly rate and the number of hours worked. The script incorporates input validation to ensure that the user enters valid values for both the hourly rate and hours worked.

How it works:

User Input: The script prompts the user to enter their hourly rate and the number of hours worked.
Input Validation: The validate_rate and validate_info functions ensure that the input values are valid. The hourly rate must be between $7.50 and $18.25, and the hours worked must be between 0 and 40.
Calculation: The main function calculates the gross pay by multiplying the hourly rate by the hours worked.
Output: The script displays the calculated gross pay to the user.
